I encourage you to read through the comments on your code and experiment with my suggestions.  Not mentally, not internally, but in code, at the console.  *Live*.  

I *also* encourage you to read through your peers' code in order to get a sense of the variety of approaches that may be taken to solve the same problem.

### To review changes
Start by selecting your file from the onscreen directory.  When it opens in the browser, click "HISTORY" -- a button in the upper right hand of the screen.  Then choose the entry that says it includes comments.

Let me know if you have trouble reading these, or understanding them.
